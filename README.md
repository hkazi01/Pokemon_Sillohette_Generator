# Pokemon_Sillohette_Generator
Save 3 PNG pictures of any Pokemon and save them as poke1, poke2, and poke3 and place the photos in the same folder as the program. The program then will save 3 new files titles save1, save2, and save3. These three files contain the finished picture of each Pokemon silhouette. It doesn't work perfectly so you many need to manually fill in some spots.
